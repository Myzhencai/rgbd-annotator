Name says it all.

## Installation instructions
Right now, just works on Ubuntu. Tested on 15.04 and 15.10. Should be easy to run on OS X as well, but the install script assumes Ubuntu.

```bash
./scripts/install
```

## Running
```bash
npm start

# navigate to http://localhost:8080
```

## Publishing to GitHub Pages
```bash
./scripts/publish "Commit message"
```

## TODO

### Low priority
- Handle window resize
- Handle on mobile (touch input)
- Resize handles on zoom
